Have you found any dimension fragments? The more fragments you find, the longer you'll be allowed to stay in the dimension gap. Dimension fragments are watched over by the guardians of ancient magic.<br>
If you begin to feel overwhelmed by your mission and want to take a break, just let me know! You always have that option!<br>
