<font color="LEVEL">[What are the Seven Signs?]</font><br>
During the reign of the Elmoreden Empire, seven powerful seals were crafted by Einhasad, the Goddess of Light, to contain Shilen, the Goddess of Death.<br1>
Two groups, the Rulers of Dawn and the Revolutionaries of Dusk, are now battling for control of the seals. To whom will you pledge your allegiance?<br>
The Rulers of Dawn consist of castle-holding clans or alliances; the Revolutionaries of Dusk consist of everyone else. The struggle for the Seven Signs is ultimately a battle between castle-owners and non-castle owners.<br>
